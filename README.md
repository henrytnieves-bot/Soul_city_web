Inspiration

Soul City was inspired by games like My Singing Monsters and classic city simulators, as well as the idea that people can create their own music by layering sounds in any way they choose. We wanted to explore how AI-driven characters and layered audio could create playful social interactions while giving users a creative space to express themselves.

Our goal was to combine creativity, simulation, and music into something that feels alive, dynamic, and fun.

What It Does

Soul City is an interactive city sandbox playground where users can either observe or actively participate.

Citizens move throughout the map, interact with one another, and hold conversations. Each character is powered by its own AI agent and comes with a unique prewritten backstory, leading to dynamic and varied interactions.

Users can also pick up characters and place them together in different combinations. Each combination layers musical elements in real time, allowing players to create evolving soundscapes through experimentation and play.

How We Built It

Game Engine: Unity

AI Integration: Google Gemini API (multiple AI agents with individual behaviors and backstories)

Audio Production: Reaper DAW (for editing and refining music clips)

Unity serves as the foundation of Soul City, managing the environment, movement, and interactivity. AI agents are integrated to power character behavior and dialogue, while carefully designed audio layers allow for synchronized, dynamic music creation.

Challenges We Ran Into

This was a large-scale project with many interconnected systems. Some of the biggest challenges included:

Synchronizing multiple audio tracks without drift

Balancing AI behavior across many agents

Dynamically managing character movement states

Implementing effective pathfinding for city citizens

Designing a gameplay loop that felt both intuitive and creative

Each system had to function independently while also working seamlessly with the others.

Accomplishments We're Proud Of

We’re especially proud of how all the elements of Soul City come together cohesively.

The environment, moving characters, AI interactions, music systems, and user interactivity were developed separately by different team members. Seeing these components integrate into a unified, natural-feeling experience has been one of our biggest achievements.

What We Learned

Throughout development, we gained experience in:

Real-time audio scheduling

Multi-agent AI interaction

Systems integration within Unity

Collaborative development and task coordination

Most importantly, we learned how to divide complex work across a team and successfully bring everything together into a polished final product
